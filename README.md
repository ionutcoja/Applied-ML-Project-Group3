## Setup Instructions

> **Note:** All commands below are intended to be run in your IDE terminal.

### 1. Install Required Libraries

To install all necessary dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Main File

Before starting the API, you must first run the main script to ensure everything is properly initialized. Let it finish before proceeding.

```
python3 main.py
```
### 3. Start the API

In a separate terminal, run:

```
uvicorn api_main:app --reload
```
### 4. Access the API

Once the API is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```
### 5. Send a Prediction Request

You can test the API using a curl command. In the same terminal where you ran main.py, run:

```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"words": "[\"triste\", \"world\"]", "lid": "[\"lang2\", \"lang1\"]"}'
```

The API can also be tested through the app itself, using input of the format:

```
{
  "words": "[\"triste\", \"child\", \"esta\", \"crying\"]", 
  "lid": "[\"lang2\", \"lang1\", \"lang2\",Â \"lang1\"]"
}
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error about a missing library, install it manually:

```
pip install library_name
```

### Notes

The script main.py trains two models:

  - A baseline Logistic Regression model.

  - An advanced model (XGBoost).

The API uses the advanced model by default. If you want to change which model the API uses, update the file passed to joblib.load on line 17 of api_main.py from 'advanced_model.joblib' to 'logreg_model.joblib':

```
model = joblib.load("advanced_model.joblib")
```
